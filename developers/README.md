# Build on SZL — Provenanced AI Infrastructure

**SZL Holdings developer hub** · Doctrine v11 (LOCKED 749 declarations / 14 unique axioms / 163 tracked sorries) · License: Apache-2.0
Maintained by Yachay `<yachay@szlholdings.dev>` · Founder: Stephen Paul Lutar Jr.

> Every action signed. Every decision gated. Every receipt verifiable.

SZL Holdings builds a **formally-verified governance gate for agentic AI**. This repo is the
developer-facing entry point: quickstart, full API reference, MCP integration, and runnable examples.
Build your own "organ" on the same substrate the shipping flagships use.

## The shipping flagships

Two flagships ship today with live `/healthz`:

| Flagship | Role | Live base URL |
|----------|------|---------------|
| **a11oy** | Λ-gate router / policy + receipt substrate; hosts the Hatun-MCP catalog. Bundles the **Sentinel** (policy / immune), **Memory** (provenance anchoring) and **Operator** (receipt-DAG) verticals — internal codenames *sentra*, *amaru*, *rosie*, retired as standalone Spaces and consolidated here. | `https://szlholdings-a11oy.hf.space` |
| **killinchu** | Defense vertical — counter-UAS / drone intelligence | `https://szlholdings-killinchu.hf.space` |

Both shipping flagships return Doctrine v11 verbatim from `/healthz`: `749 declarations / 14 unique axioms / 163 tracked sorries`, locked at `c7c0ba17`. Λ uniqueness is **Conjecture 1 (NOT a theorem)** — stated honestly. SLSA **L1 (honest)**.

- [`mcp_claude_config.json`](./EXAMPLES/mcp_claude_config.json) — drop-in Claude Desktop config
- [`sentra_filter_example.py`](./EXAMPLES/sentra_filter_example.py) — submit a payload, get verdict + receipt
- [`rosie_command_example.py`](./EXAMPLES/rosie_command_example.py) — dispatch a personal-aide command

## The provenance model in one paragraph

You call a flagship endpoint. The a11oy **Sentinel** policy gate evaluates the input deny-by-default. The decision is wrapped
in a **DSSE** (Dead Simple Signing Envelope) signed with ECDSA-P256-SHA256, and chained onto the
**Khipu Merkle DAG** — a hash-linked, summation-checked ledger that is **replay-verifiable offline.**
You can verify any receipt against the organ's public key (`/khipu/pubkey`). Deploy the whole thing
**airgapped** with UDS Zarf bundles.
