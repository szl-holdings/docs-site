# Flagships

SZL Holdings ships **two products on one signed substrate**: **[a11oy](/flagships/a11oy)** — the
governed-AI command platform — and **[killinchu](/flagships/killinchu)** — counter-UAS drone &
vessel intelligence. a11oy delivers its capabilities as internal verticals — **Memory**,
**Sentinel**, and **Operator** — each mapped to an [anatomy organ](/anatomy/), cross-referenced
to the Ouroboros Thesis ([DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20434276](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20434276)),
and backed by the Lean kernel [`lutar-lean`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/lutar-lean).

::: info Honesty note on SLSA
Some repo badges historically read "SLSA 3". The **doctrine-correct, honest level is
SLSA L1** — provenance is generated but not L3-verified, and cosign signing is **PENDING**
(see [Compliance & Security](/compliance)). Where this site and a badge disagree, this site
is correct.
