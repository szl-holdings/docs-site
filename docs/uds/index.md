# UDS — Unified Demo Surface

::: warning Coming Soon — June 16, 2026
The **Unified Demo Surface (UDS)** launches at **Warhacker, San Diego — June 16, 2026**.
This page documents the surface that is being wired now; the public, end-to-end demo
goes live on June 16. Until then, the individual flagship surfaces and the
[Hatun-MCP](#mcp-governed-tools) server are the live entry points.
:::

UDS is the single, governed demo surface that fans a customer request out across the
five SZL flagships, gathers each organ's signed verdict, and returns a **3-of-4
Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus receipt** — every step provenanced on the Khipu
chain.

> Doctrine v11 **LOCKED** — 749 declarations / 14 axioms / 163 sorries · locked_at `c7c0ba17`.
> v12 declared (781 / 14 / 194, same 14 axioms, replay hash unchanged) — additive only.
> SLSA L1 (honest). Λ = Conjecture 1 (not a theorem). Quechua names are brand naming only.

## What UDS does

1. **Single intake** — one request hits the UDS aggregator (`killinchu` acts as the
   consensus aggregator at the `/api/killinchu/uds/v1/*` surface).
2. **Fan-out to organs** — each flagship (`a11oy`, `amaru`, `sentra`, `rosie`,
   `killinchu`) signs its verdict with its own ECDSA-P256 cosign key
   (`<organ>-cosign`).
3. **Quorum** — a canonical receipt is emitted only when **3 of 4** organ signatures
   agree (the BFT safety property). Disagreement yields a clearly-labelled rejection
   receipt.
4. **Provenance** — the consensus receipt is pushed to the public Khipu chain and a
   Rekor transparency entry, so any party can re-verify the decision years later.

## MCP-governed tools

Until UDS opens publicly, the governed entry point is the **Hatun-MCP** server
(streamable-HTTP, 16 governed tools) at
`https://szlholdings-hatun-mcp.hf.space/mcp/`. State-changing tools require an API
key plus a 2-person Yuyay approval. See the [MCP usage notes](/api/) and the
[flagship pages](/flagships/) for the live, today-available surfaces.

## Honesty labels

- **UDS public demo is not yet live** — it opens June 16, 2026. The consensus
  primitive (`/api/killinchu/uds/v1/mission/execute`, `/consensus/verify`) is the
  surface being wired; this page will flip from *Coming Soon* to *Live* on launch.
- Per-organ signatures are **real ECDSA-P256-SHA256** over the DSSE PAE — verifiable
  with `cosign verify-blob --key <organ>.pub`.
- Drone positions used in UDS killinchu demos are **deterministic simulated** (seeded),
  and geofence zones are a **static snapshot** — both clearly labelled at the API.
